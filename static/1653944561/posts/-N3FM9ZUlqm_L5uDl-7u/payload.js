All the major coins declined this month by over 25%. Solana is one of the crypto projects that have posted a massive decline not only this most but this year,\n\nSolana is down 16% for the past 7 days and a 58% drop for the past 30 days. This is how bad the Solana coin has been plummeting. Although Solana posted some recovery for the decline posted in the past 24 hours of this writing, the market is still unstable. \n\nHowever, Bitgert (BRISE) has been one of the cryptocurrencies doing well in the industry during this bearish market. According to the Coinmarketcap, the Bitgert price posted a 40% rise over the past 24 hours. But the Bitgert coin has been bullish most of the time during this bear market. Here are reasons why Solana and Bitgert prices have been behaving like this.\n\nSolana\nSolana has been plummeting mainly because of the bear market triggered by the FED regulations. The regulations have affected stock markets, and the crypto market is one of the affected markets. These regulations have triggered massive Solana sell pressure, resulting in massive withdrawals. That’s why the Solana price has been plummeting.\n\nOn the other hand, Solana’s declining price might have been driven by the growing competition. There are more attractive crypto projects like Bitgert that are making Solana holders sell to join them. These are just some of the major reasons why Solana’s price has been plunging and may continue to plunge.\n\nBitgert\nBitgert has been bullish when Solana has been growing bearish. In fact, Bitgert reached a new ATH in 2022, when Solana was plunging. The biggest factors driving bullish Bitgert are the fast-growing Bitgert ecosystem and the highly disruptive Bitgert products. The fast delivery of the Bitgert products and projects automatically grows the number of Bitgert investors and users.\n\nThe highly disruptive products and projects are growing the adoption of the Bitgert projects. A good example is the mass adoption of the Bitgert BRC20 blockchain because of its zero gas fee and the fastest speed in the industry. The huge number of new crypto investors joining Bitgert because of the upcoming DeFi, NFT, and Web3 products and 1000+ new Startup Studio projects keeps the Bitgert con bullish.\n\nThe bottom line is that Bitgert (BRISE) has everything to be the next big cryptocurrency due to its consistent bullish growth. That’s why even Solana holders are selling to join Bitgert (BRISE) today.\n\n",previewText:"Key Points:\n-Solana is heavily affected by the bear market\n-Bitgert BRC20 chain massive adoption is growing price\n-Bitgert’s fast-growing ecosystem is attracting investors",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fctfx.co.il\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2021\u002F10\u002FSolana.png",title:"WHY SOLANA PRICE PLUMMET AND BITGERT PRICE UP BY 40%",updatedDate:"2022-05-29T15:08:36.804Z"}}],fetch:{},mutations:[]});
