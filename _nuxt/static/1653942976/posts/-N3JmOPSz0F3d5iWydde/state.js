All the major coins declined this month by over 25%. Solana is one of the crypto projects that have posted a massive decline not only this most but this year,\n\nSolana is down 16% for the past 7 days and a 58% drop for the past 30 days. This is how bad the Solana coin has been plummeting. Although Solana posted some recovery for the decline posted in the past 24 hours of this writing, the market is still unstable. \n\nHowever, Bitgert (BRISE) has been one of the cryptocurrencies doing well in the industry during this bearish market. According to the Coinmarketcap, the Bitgert price posted a 40% rise over the past 24 hours. But the Bitgert coin has been bullish most of the time during this bear market. Here are reasons why Solana and Bitgert prices have been behaving like this.\n\nSolana\nSolana has been plummeting mainly because of the bear market triggered by the FED regulations. The regulations have affected stock markets, and the crypto market is one of the affected markets. These regulations have triggered massive Solana sell pressure, resulting in massive withdrawals. That’s why the Solana price has been plummeting.\n\nOn the other hand, Solana’s declining price might have been driven by the growing competition. There are more attractive crypto projects like Bitgert that are making Solana holders sell to join them. These are just some of the major reasons why Solana’s price has been plunging and may continue to plunge.\n\nBitgert\nBitgert has been bullish when Solana has been growing bearish. In fact, Bitgert reached a new ATH in 2022, when Solana was plunging. The biggest factors driving bullish Bitgert are the fast-growing Bitgert ecosystem and the highly disruptive Bitgert products. The fast delivery of the Bitgert products and projects automatically grows the number of Bitgert investors and users.\n\nThe highly disruptive products and projects are growing the adoption of the Bitgert projects. A good example is the mass adoption of the Bitgert BRC20 blockchain because of its zero gas fee and the fastest speed in the industry. The huge number of new crypto investors joining Bitgert because of the upcoming DeFi, NFT, and Web3 products and 1000+ new Startup Studio projects keeps the Bitgert con bullish.\n\nThe bottom line is that Bitgert (BRISE) has everything to be the next big cryptocurrency due to its consistent bullish growth. That’s why even Solana holders are selling to join Bitgert (BRISE) today.\n\n",previewText:"Key Points:\n-Solana is heavily affected by the bear market\n-Bitgert BRC20 chain massive adoption is growing price\n-Bitgert’s fast-growing ecosystem is attracting investors",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fctfx.co.il\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2021\u002F10\u002FSolana.png",title:"WHY SOLANA PRICE PLUMMET AND BITGERT PRICE UP BY 40%",updatedDate:"2022-05-29T15:08:36.804Z",id:"-N3FM9ZUlqm_L5uDl-7u"},{author:a,content:"Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView tracked an uninspiring day for Bitcoin, with $800 of losses coming in a single hourly candle several hours before the start of trading.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency had avoided volatility on the release of minutes from the United States Federal Reserve's Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC).\n\nThese had avoided any serious divergence from already known facts about economic policy, and despite concerns thatanti-inflation measures could lead to a recession, no mention of the word \"recession\" appeared in the minutes.\n\nEven legacy markets remained comparatively cool, with analyst Dylan LeClair describing the situation as \"eerily calm\" based on volatility data.\n\nCointelegraph contributor Michaël van de Poppe, who on May 25 had predicted a move towards $32,800 for BTC\u002FUSD, reiterated that a breakout from its current trading zone was \"coming relatively soon.\"\n\nFor the meantime, however, on-chain signals meant that there was likely no impetus for significant price changes, according to fellow trader and analyst Rekt Capital.\n\nAnalyzing on-chain volumes, it became clear that neither buyers nor sellers were prepared to make a bold statement at current levels.\n\n\"Previous periods of high sell-side BTC volume preceded periods where buyer volume started trickling in in the following weeks.

It relied on code and a sister token, luna, to maintain a $1 value. But as digital currency prices fell, investors fled the stablecoin, sending UST tumbling — and taking luna down with it.\n\nAt its height, the old luna — now known as “luna classic” — had a circulating supply of over $40 billion.\n\nNow, luna has a new iteration, which investors are calling Terra 2.0. It is already trading on exchanges including Bybit, Kucoin and Huobi. Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, says it will list luna on Tuesday.\n\nIts launch has not gone well.\n\nAfter reaching a peak of $19.53 on Saturday, luna dropped as low as $4.39 just hours later, according to CoinGecko data. It has since settled at a price of around $5.90.\n\nAnalysts are deeply skeptical about the chances of Terra’s revived blockchain being a success. It will have to compete with a host of other so-called “Layer 1” networks — the infrastructure that underpins cryptocurrencies like ethereum, solana and cardano.\n\nTerra is distributing luna tokens through what’s called an “airdrop.” Most will go to those who held luna classic and UST before their collapse, in an effort to compensate investors.\n\nBut many investors burned by the debacle are unlikely to trust Terra a second time, experts say.

It’s essential to understand precisely how the game’s mechanics work to understand if STEPN economic model is sustainable.\n\nWhile players only need a single pair of STEPN’s NFT sneakers to start playing, owning multiple pairs means they can earn more GST token. Sneakers generate energy daily, and every five minutes spent moving converts one point of energy into an amount of GST tokens decided by the sneakers’ efficiency rating. \n\nPlayers who hold at least two pairs of sneakers can also “mint” new pairs by burning GMT and GST tokens. “Virgin” sneakers that have not been used to mint new shoes need fewer tokens, with the cost increasing every successive mint. After minting seven times, sneakers will no longer be able to mint anymore. \n\nSTEPN’s economic structure is similar to that of Axie Infinity, the first play-to-earn game to hit it big. In Axie Infinity, players burn AXS and SLP tokens to “breed” Axies, which are needed to play the game and earn tokens; in STEPN, sneaker minting is the name of the game.\n\nBoth Axie Infinity and STEPN rely on new players joining to keep the game profitable for existing ones. If demand for new sneakers dries up, their price on the secondary market will fall. This means fewer new sneakers will get minted, removing buying pressure from GST and GMT. Meanwhile, those already playing the game will continue earning tokens to sell on the open market, driving the value of GMT and GST down in a race to the bottom. \n\nIf such a scenario sounds far-fetched, it shouldn’t. This is what happened to Axie Infinity after it surged in popularity during the “NFT summer” of 2021. Token prices and demand for Axies soared as new players entered the game, sped up by gaming guilds renting their Axies out to players who couldn’t afford a set in return for a portion of their earnings. However, with so many players earning and selling the game’s SLP token, its price eroded, making it less attractive for newer players to start. \n\nEventually, Axie Infinity’s honeymoon period wore off, and the game struggled to retain players. Once the monetary incentives disappeared, and fewer people were playing the game for fun, demand for Axies and the tokens needed to breed them cratered. The price movement of the game’s flagship AXS token encapsulates this story perfectly. AXS soared from $4 last May to an all-time time of $164 in November. Six months later, it’s trading at just over $20. \n\nHowever, unlike Axie Infinity, STEPN has introduced some new mechanics in an attempt to balance its token economy. GST, the earnable token analogue to Axie Infinity’s SLP, has more uses in the game beyond creating new sneakers. Players need GST to repair sneakers (necessary to continue earning), unlock more sneaker sockets, level up sneakers, and upgrade sneaker gems. While this added utility should help keep demand for GST high and thus increase players’ profits from playing, it does nothing to stop the game from entering a death spiral once player growth plateaus. \n\nAdditionally, because STEPN can limit the number of new players entering the game through its invited-based sign-up system, it has more control over how fast it grows. This is integral to managing the STEPN economy. As Twitter user PhABCD recently pointed out, STEPN’s sneaker inflation is currently on track to increase by an unsustainable 31,000% over the next year. To slow down sneaker production, the game’s designers have two options: increase the cost of minting new shoes or decrease demand by slowing user growth.\n\nBy managing STEPN’s growth, the designers can stop it from flying too close to the sun for a while. However, there will likely come a time when there won’t be enough new players or minting shoes won’t be profitable enough for existing users. At this point, STEPN’s economy will be in danger of unraveling, which could crash its tokens and NFT sneakers. \n\nLooking to the Future\nWhile it may not happen tomorrow or even next month, previous play-to-earn games show that STEPN’s current model is unsustainable. Unless the game makes drastic changes, a crash is almost inevitable. \n\nWith this in mind, it appears that the STEPN team’s primary goal is to keep the game alive for as long as possible to profit from sneaker NFT trading fees. According to a recent TechCrunch article, STEPN currently brings in over $100 million in monthly trading fees. If this keeps up until the STEPN team’s vested GMT tokens start to unlock in January 2023, the game will have made almost as much money as the total value of those tokens at the current price of $1.37. As the team’s tokens unlock incrementally until 2027, there’s a good chance that the majority of its profits will come from trading fees. The value of the vested tokens is almost irrelevant, and they should not be considered proof that the STEPN team has any real skin in the game regarding STEPN’s prolonged success. \n\nAdditionally, anyone involved with STEPN appears to be very cagy about who they talk to and who can contact them. Crypto Briefing has tried to contact STEPN team members and ambassadors several times since we first covered the game in March and has not received any response. Instead of talking to crypto-native publications, the game’s creators appear more interested in getting STEPN into Web2 media outlets such as Forbes and TechCrunch. The official email on the STEPN website is unresponsive, and anyone directly associated with the game on Twitter has their direct messages turned off. It almost feels like STEPN is anticipating controversy and is making its operations as water-tight as possible before a coming storm. \n\nThose who started playing STEPN early are raking in tokens and likely up on their initial investments by several orders of magnitude. However, anyone just beginning may find it more difficult to profit going forward. STEPN has certainly made people money and encouraged many more to take up a healthier, more active lifestyle. But will that be enough to retain players when rewards dry up? Let’s see. \n\n",previewText:"Looking into STEPN economics ",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fcryptobriefing.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2022\u002F05\u002Fstepn-cover-2-1024x538.jpg",title:"Why You Should Be Worried About STEPN",updatedDate:"2022-05-30T11:52:27.441Z",id:"-N3Jnr-72HuLwwlcfNn5"}],token:b},serverRendered:true,routePath:"\u002Fposts\u002F-N3JmOPSz0F3d5iWydde",config:{_app:{basePath:"\u002FNuxtCryptoBlog\u002F",assetsPath:"\u002FNuxtCryptoBlog\u002F_nuxt\u002F",cdnURL:b}}}}("Barak",null));
