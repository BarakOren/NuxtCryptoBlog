But now, we're seeing that a) seller volume is declining over time. And b) no $BTC buyer volume has come in following the high seller volume,\" he explained to Twitter followers on the day.",previewText:"Latest bitcoin breakout",thumbnail:"https:\u002F\u002Fimages.cointelegraph.com\u002Fimages\u002F717_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS91cGxvYWRzLzIwMjItMDUvOWQ2NGExODAtOWQ0MC00MmY1LWE4YjktY2ZjYmFlM2EyOGYzLmpwZw==.jpg",title:"BTC price breakout due ‘relatively soon’ as Bitcoin volumes spook traders",updatedDate:"2022-05-29T15:11:56.095Z"}}],fetch:{},mutations:[]});
